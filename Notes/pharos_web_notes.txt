1. Supervisord is still run with python2
but needs to point to the new config file

/usr/local/anaconda2/bin/python /usr/local/anaconda2/bin/supervisord -c /scr2/sedm/supervisord.conf.py3_6

2. The gunicorn startup now needs to point to the custom python3 version
and needs to be started in the /scr2/sedm/sedm-site-py3 directory

/scr2/sedm/anaconda3/bin/python /scr2/sedm/anaconda3/bin/gunicorn -w 4 sedm_flask:app

1. Supervisord is still run with python2
but needs to point to the new config file

/data/sedmdrp/miniconda3/envs/python2/bin/python /data/sedmdrp/miniconda3/envs/python2/bin/supervisord -c /data/sedmdrp/sedmpy/config/supervisord.conf

2. The gunicorn startup now needs to point to the custom python3 version
and needs to be started in the /data/sedmdrp/sedmpy/web directory

/data/sedmdrp/miniconda3/bin/python /data/sedmdrp/miniconda3/bin/gunicorn -w 4 sedm_flask:app
